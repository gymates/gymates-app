### User Story

As a developer, I want the project to be properly configured with essential tools, linters, formatters, and testing frameworks so that development is consistent, maintainable, and efficient.

### Details

- Configure TypeScript for both frontend and backend.
- Set up Nx workspace for monorepo management.
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
- Set up Jest for unit and integration testing (frontend and backend).
- Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks (lint, tests).
- Add recommended VSCode settings and extensions.
- Ensure all scripts are available in `package.json`.
- Document setup in `README.md`.
